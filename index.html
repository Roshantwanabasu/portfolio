			  <h2>How I Landed My First Software Engineering Job</h2>

			  <p>Landing a job just after you graduate is really hard and challenging. 
					You performed well on all the semesters , 
					have a certificate with good grades and now you are ready to enter the stage
					of profession. With all the hard works and efforts you have put on during the college days, 
					you now have a great expectations of easily getting a good job. 
					But anybody who have just graduated and started their job hunt knows 
					the fact that how long and frustrating this process can be.

				<h2>POONHILL, NEPAL</h2>
				<h3>Author: Anu Shrestha</h3>
				<p>This was my first ever longer hiking journey to POONHILL with my college mates.
					We were all excited for the trip and planned so much for the whole time at college.
					By that time it was all fun and all but didnt knew that i was actually 
					making memories that i can recall whenever i like.
					It was a hell of a trip,first day with all the bus rides
					along with the singing and dancing all the way to pokhara.
